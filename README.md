# Next.js + Tailwind CSS + TypeScript + ESLint + Prettier + Jest + React Testing Library

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

RoomMate is a web application that helps you find a room, house, or apartment to rent. It is a platform that connects people looking for a place to live with those who have a place to rent. It is a simple and easy-to-use platform that allows you to find the perfect place to live.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
